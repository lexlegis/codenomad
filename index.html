			<p class="editable primary-color">If some of those are correct for you, this program will be right for you. Our main goal, beside teaching you a particular programming language, is to help you understand and develop other necessary assets for landing a software developer job - from learning about tools and practices that software developers use on a daily basis to productively complete their tasks, to developing a couple of projects that you can use to show and talk about at your first job interviews.</p>
